Finite-Element-method
=====================

This code helps us to solve 2-Dimensional finite element parabolic interface problem and getting its various estimators such as time, h1, l2, space estimators.

This code helps you to solve one sample problem by changing those paramaters according to your problem this code could be reused to any parabolic interface problem.

The sample problem which I had taken for consideration is as follows:

We take for the domain the rectangle A = (0,2)x(0,1). The interface occurs at x = 1 so that A1 = (0,1)x(0,1), A2 = (1,2)x(0,1) and the interface
